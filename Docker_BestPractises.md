- Use Ubuntu trusty if possible (FROM ubuntu:trusty)
- Add Dell Cloud Market Place as maintainer for each image (MAINTAINER Dell Cloud Market Place <Cloud_Marketplace@dell.com>)
- Use a specific version for the base image (for example : FROM dell/lamp:1.0)
- Don’t do RUN apt-get update on a single line. This will cause caching issues if the referenced archive gets updated, which will make your subsequent apt-get install fail without comment.
- Avoid RUN apt-get upgrade or dist-upgrade, since many of the “essential” packages from the base images will fail to upgrade inside an unprivileged container.
- Put long or complex RUN statements on multiple lines separated with backslashes. (Ex: apt-get update )
- Minimize the number of layers by using a single RUN for multiple commands with the same logic. Combine these commands with &&.
- Lines should not exceed 80 characters 
- Expose the common, traditional ports used by the application
- Try to put the commands likely to change at the end of the docker file
- Comments format: # This a comment
- Skip a line between 2 blocks of commands
- Use supervisor if the application/process may need to be restarted from the container (eg, HTTP Server)
- Use ENTRYPOINT to use a helper/startup script
- VOLUME should be used to expose any database storage area, configuration storage, or files/folders created by the docker container
- Backup the folders used as exposed volumes and copy the content back in the startup script
- Always use absolute paths for your WORKDIR
- Use WORKDIR instead of proliferating instructions like RUN cd … && do-something, which are hard to read, troubleshoot, and maintain
- Expose variables likely to be set by the user of the container
